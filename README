I wrote several calculators (as you've seen in this repo), in order to get deeper understanding of parsing techniques such as LL, LR and recursive descent.  
The parsers themselves are written by C++, and the algorithms of building parse tables or inducing LR items are written in Python, since I want calculators to be fast and said algorithms appear like persudocode.
